This was the first time Gabby was home alone. Her parents and brother were away on a week-long trip to Hawaii. Gabby did not want to miss school, so she decided to stay home. That was a very good thing. She could stay up as late as she wanted, have people over, and sing as loud as she wanted.
She invited her friends William and Agatha over after school. She said, "Wow, it's so nice to have this house all to yourself. Your parents must really trust you!" Agatha said. Gaby's parents trusted Gaby because she always told the truth and did the right thing. William said, "Why don't you throw a party?" Gaby and Agatha gasped." Did you not hear what I just said?" William said." I did hear you. I just think Gabby could be wrong for once and shouldn't be boring," William said. Gabby thought about that. Everyone at school thought she was a softy and her parents wouldn't find out." Ok! I'll do it!" Gabby exclaimed.
Gabby invited the entire 11th grade class to her house on Friday. Lots of people came and the house was packed. Everyone seemed to be having a great time. Everyone loved the food and music at the party. But eventually the party got too crazy. People started yelling at each other, things broke, neighbors complained.
Suddenly, the door opened. It was Gaby's parents." Mom, Dad, I thought you were coming tomorrow?" Gabby asked. Her father said, "Yes, but I thought I'd surprise you with a gift." Gabby felt guilty.
