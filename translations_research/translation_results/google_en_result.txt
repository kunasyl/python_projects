Gabbidıñ's parents believe that his son is in love with him, and trust him for his love. "You could do better," said Viläm. Gabbi and Agata opened their doors. "Didn't you hear what I was saying, Sander?!" - said Viläm. "I heard you. I said to Gabbige, even if it's only once in her life, she'll be happy, and if she's happy, she'll be happy," said Agata.

Suddenly the door opened. This is Gabbid's ancestry. "Father, mother, will you come tomorrow?" - dep sūrap qaldy Gabbi. "Yes, but we came as a tosyn syi to draw milk," said his father. Gabbi is not feeling well.
