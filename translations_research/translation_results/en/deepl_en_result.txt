Alas, Gabbi was the only one who stayed with him. His ancestor, mother and grandmother, and his granddaughter Gavaiaga stayed in one apartment for a long time. Gabbi had left his parents at the school, he belonged to them as a teacher. He was very grateful. Even if his day was darkening, even if people shouted at him, even if there was a lot of pain, he remained in his own power.
After dawn he called his friends Vilam and Agatany. "If it is necessary, missagan! Bend your head in your black sleep. Your ancestors and grandparents need to have a senet on the right side!" - said Agata. Gabbid's ancestor's ancestor's ancestor's mother was very angry with him for all the things he had done, and he was very angry with you for his desire to make a big mistake. "It would be better if you were a jaqsylap junkie", - said Viläm. Gabbi and Agata looked up from their seats. "Don't you know what the sender told me to do?!" - said Viläm. "I know what you mean. I'm just saying that even if Gabbige had a refusal in his lifetime, I would not have been able to make a decision in favor of him," Agata said. Gabbi was very happy. At school, she was taught that she would not know her mom, her mother, her ancestors, her father, her father-in-law, her husband. "Jaraidy! Men būny jasaimyn!" -said Gabbi.
Gabbi shaqyrdy for a few days in front of the eleven hundred and fifteenth synyp schoolchildren. A lot of men came, all of them were very dirty. It was seen that some of them were very angry and angry. The men were both very tired and very tired. Alaida shivered in his sleep, and then he was ashamed of himself. The men looked at each other, the aiqailai began, the zattar qirady, syndy, and the blind men began to shaghymdana.
A mezette was overflowing. Būl Gabbid's ancestor is his mother. "Äke, my mother, will you come sooner?" - asked Gabbi. "Yes, we came in the tosyn syi retin for the right-handed silyq tartu", - said all of her parents. Gabbi felt himself to be uncomfortable, uncomfortable.
