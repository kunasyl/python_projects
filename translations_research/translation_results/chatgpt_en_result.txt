"Alga≈ü and Gabbi were the only ones left at home. His parents and sisters had gone on a week-long trip to Gavaia. Gabbi didn't feel like going to school and decided to stay at home. He thought he deserved a break. The day seemed long and dull, and no matter how many times he looked out the window, no one seemed to be coming. Nevertheless, he managed to keep himself busy.
Later in the afternoon, Gabbi's friends William and Agatha came to visit him. "I would have come sooner if I had known you needed me! You are all alone in this big house of yours. You need someone to keep you company!" Agatha said. Gabbi's mother had left him with a long list of chores, and he was not in the mood to do any of them. "If you make yourself useful, you can have some fun," said William. Gabbi and Agatha spent the rest of the day talking, laughing, and sharing stories. "Did you forget about me?" asked William. "I haven't forgotten you. I thought I'd give Gabbi some company, and I ended up staying longer than I had planned," replied Agatha. Gabbi was grateful to have them there. He felt that he had no one else to turn to, not even his parents. He was amazed at how he was able to connect with his friends and share his feelings with them.
Gabbi woke up early on Friday morning and went to school. The school was deserted, and he felt like the only person in the world. He couldn't wait for the school day to be over. When he got home, he found that his parents had returned. They had brought him a small gift from their trip, but Gabbi felt like he had no use for it. He was just happy that they were back. He felt like his life was complete with them around.
They had a family meal that night, and Gabbi's father asked, "So, my son, how have you been? We missed you." "I've been okay, Dad. I missed you guys too," replied Gabbi. His father smiled and said, "That's good to hear. We'll talk more tomorrow. Get some rest, son." Gabbi felt relieved that he could finally talk to his parents and that they were interested in how he was doing. He went to bed feeling content."
